Arch of Ctesiphon;The Arch of Ctesiphon, just outside Baghdad, part of a palace built by Sasanian kings in the sixth century AD.Ctesiphon was one of the great cities of ancient Mesopotamia and the capital of the Iranian Parthian Empire and its successor, the Sassanid Persian Empire, for more than 600 years.The Sasanians were an Iranian dynasty, but they used traditional Mesopotamian building techniques. The arch, a huge open audience hall 30 meters high and some 43 meters long, should have required massive scaffolding, but the Mesopotamians leant the courses of brickwork back at an angle, so that each course was built against its predecessor, and only a mobile tower for the builders was necessary. The arch was flanked by fa?ades decorated with blank arcading and pilasters, but the one on the right collapsed a century ago.;44.58088753;33.0936823;0

Pueblo Alto;This Great House was begun in AD 1020 to 1050. It's location made the community visible to most of the inhabitants of the San Juan Basin. The community was central to a bead and turquoise processing industry that influenced the development of all villages in the canyon. Chert tool production was also common.;-107.9576379;36.06969305;0

Casa Chiquita;This village was expanded in the late 1100's. Architecture and design show significant change at this late period. Open plazas disappeared, large blocks of stone were used in masonry and kiva design was in the northern Mesa Verde tradition.;-107.9767284;36.06904055;0
Kin Kletso;This town shows strong evidence of construction and occupation by Pueblo peoples from the northern San Juan Basin. Its rectangular shape and design is related to the Pueblo II cultural group, rather than the Pueblo III style or its Chacoan variant. It contains about 55 rooms, four ground floor kivas and a tower which may have functioned as a kiva or religious center. Evidence of an obsidian production industry were discovered here. The village was completed in the late 1100's.;-107.9702573;36.06501025;0

Pueblo Bonito;The largest Great House covers almost 8000 m? and incorporates at least 650 rooms. In parts of the village, the structure was four stories high. The builder's use of core and veneer architecture and multi-story construction produced massive masonry walls as much as three feet (1 meter) thick. Pueblo Bonito is divided into two sections by a wall running north to south through the central plaza. A Great Kiva is placed on either side of the wall, creating a symmetrical pattern common to many of the Great Houses.;-107.9618519;36.06045896;0
Chetro Ketl;Begun in AD 1020 to 1050, this house contains between 450 and 550 rooms and just a single Great Kiva. Scientists estimate that construction on this house alone took 29,135 person-hours.;-107.9543757;36.06012188;0

Tsin Kletsin;This community lies very near a massive earthenware structure known as the Weritos dam.
