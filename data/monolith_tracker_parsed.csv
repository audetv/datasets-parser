1;Original Utah Monolith, United States;2020-12-08T07:36:40+00:00;2020-11-27;Exact;"<p>On November 18, 2020, state biologists of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources were carrying out a survey of bighorn sheep from a helicopter when one of the biologists spotted the pillar.  According to satellite images, it was installed sometime after August 2015 and before October 2016.</p>
<p>After much speculation about the monolith, the art group The Most Famous Artist took credit for the Utah Monolith. Monolith photos posted by the group do not match the build quality nor the shape of the original monolith. It is widely thought that the group is simply capitalizing on the popularity of the story, and they did not in fact build the first monolith. The true artist is still unknown at this time.</p>
<p>Since, the BLM has ceased the monolith. They cite the issue of people removing anything from public lands, and in this case if the public owns the art.</p>

Unlike other monolith like the one in Utah, this one was not secured to the ground. On December 4, three young men, from Orange County, referring to themselves as military veterans, livestreamed themselves destroying the monolith, replacing it with a large wooden cross and chanting ""Christ is king!"".</p>
<p> On December 5, a group of four artists (Wade McKenzie, Travis Kenney, Randall Kenney and Jared Riddle) revealed that they were the creators of the original structure, and after it was toppled, decided to replace it. According to one of the artists, Wade McKenzie, “We intended for it to be a piece of guerrilla art. But when it was taken down in such a malicious manner, we decided we needed to replace it.” The next day, the local deputy city manager, Terrie Banish, said that the city was ""happy to see it return"".</p>

<p>The monolith disappeared the day after it was discovered.</p>
<p>Locals suspected the monolith to be an end of year prank, which are common in the area. However, the quick disappearance suggests otherwise, because if it was, locals say, 'it would still have been here'. The owner of the land was not happy with the monolith because of the visitors, but does not say he is the one who removed it.</p>

Its construction seems amateuristic, and the monolith appears dented in many photographs. The farmer in whose field the monolith was found was contacted by an unknown caller the evening before and asked if it was allowed to place an object in his field as a joke. The farmer consented, without knowing what the object would be. The following day the monolith was discovered. Because of the call, the classification of this monolith is easily questionable.</p>
<p>To local news, the farmer explained that he was unaware of the hype surrounding the monoliths discovered elsewhere. The farmer thinks it is a fun distraction from coronavirus, he's pleasantly surprised by the attention from visitors that come to take pictures, but he ultimately thinks the monolith 'is just a stupid pole'.</p>

";3 sided, Polished, flat, Stainless Steel, P-Class;During the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys and low-lying ground surrounding Glastonbury so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Sweet Track, west of Glastonbury, which is one of the oldest engineered roads known and was the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe, until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in Belmarsh Prison. Tree-ring dating (dendrochronology) of the timbers has enabled very precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806 BC. It has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury#Prehistory, Art;https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/Banksy-inspired.jpg;https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/268105383.jpg;2020-12-09;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/new-monolith-appears-bansky-glastonbury-tor-b231151.html;https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/18931580.monolith-appears-glastonbury-tor-somerset/ https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/monolith-appears-glastonbury-tor-not-4781333 https://t.co/CJDccHfgyC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury#Prehistory https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTWwPstRfmM https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/268105394.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/268105391.jpg.gallery.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/newFile-7.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/newFile-6.jpg;51.144444;-2.698611;0;gcn4fwdcvz3u

The Klingon language is the constructed language spoken by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek Universe. So, the message is in Klingon font but written in spanish. </p>
<p>The message reads 'VITOR SANTANA BENDITA TRIBALDOS 2020'. </p>
<p><strong>EXCLUSIVE REPORT</strong> for Monolith Tracker, from Kawak Cabrejos, Calafell, Catalunya, Spain.<br />
Visit on January 5th, 2021.<br />
Material: stainless steel. Probable thickness: 2 millimeters.</p>
<p>Hollow. It produces a deep and prolonged sound when struck with the open hand, like a huge drum: booooommm… booooommm… A sound that seems to come from far away. Surely, when hit on top of a hill, it can be heard at great distances. It sounds identical to the Santes Creus Monolith, in Catalunya. When the sun hit him, it could be seen for miles, from the road. </p>
<p><strong>Construction:</strong></p>
<p>Single sheet of three meters high by approx one meter wide folded on three sides and with a single weld. Triangular apex, welded at very precise points.<br />
Inside the apex an inner triangle of a darker color is discovered, it is assumed that it is the product of the heat of the weld, although it is not exactly known.<br />
The metal is treated with a combination of polished and patinated / burnished, it is highly reflective, smooth and warm.</p>
<p>Mayor Ortega, who has worked with iron in particular for years, explains that whoever made the object is very skillful and efficient; that the letters have been cut with a laser; and that the folding machine to bend a sheet of metal of that size is only found in large workshops. An approximate budget to design, make and install the structure would be at least € 2,500, about $ 3,000.</p>
<p><strong>Installation:</strong></p>
<p>It was installed on the top of a hill, that of Ribagorda, which dominates an entire extension that includes the Hermitage of Santa Ana, the town of Tribaldos, and the town and the Monastery of Santiago de Uclés. Installed at night, from December 20 to 21, 2020, in that place, at that time of year, it tends to get sub-zero temperatures and freeze the land. It was also nailed vertically with a cast iron pillar of about 80 or 90 cm long, welded and firmly screwed to the structure and to a triangular base also made of cast iron.</p>

The Tribaldos monolith was stolen and then abandoned on land. People, Major of Tribaldos and Guardia Civil searched, found and rescued the stolen structure. The Cuenca monolith is under custody now. Everybody is very impressed in a good way. The Guardia Civil (military police) advised the Major to keep the M in a warehouse and for the moment not to put it back to the original place at the top of the hill., Symbols";https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/Monometalito%20Tribaldos%2C%20visita%205%20enero%202021%2007_0.jpg;https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/Klingon.png;2020-12-21;https://www.eldigitalcastillalamancha.es/actualidad/364466027/Aparece-en-un-pequeno-de-Castilla-La-Mancha-uno-de-los-monolitos-que-intrigan-al-mundo.html;https://www.ondacero.es/emisoras/castilla-la-mancha/cuenca/noticias/monolitos-metalicos-llegan-cuenca_202012215fe09509ae19b30001f82d50.html https://www.lasnoticiasdecuenca.es/provincia/misterio-del-monolito-llega-pequena-localidad-tribaldos-52332 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPfKg53VcBI&feature=emb_logo https://www.quijotedigital.es/articulo/mancha-conquense/aparece-forma-repentina-misterioso-monolito-acero-inoxidable-tribaldos-cuenca/20201222161005076978.html https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/monolito%20grabado%20idioma%20Klingon%20Tribaldos%20Cuenca%20Espa%C3%B1a%202020%2001.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/monolito-grabado%20idioma%20ET%20Tribaldos%20Cuenca%20Espa%C3%B1a%202020%2006.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/monolito-grabado%20idioma%20ET%20Tribaldos%20Cuenca%20Espa%C3%B1a%202020.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/Monometalito%20grabado%20idioma%20Klingon%20Tribaldos%20Cuenca%20Espa%C3%B1a%202020%2008.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/Monometalito%20grabado%20idioma%20Klingon%20Tribaldos%20Cuenca%20Espa%C3%B1a%202020%2009.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2020-12/monolito-grabado%20idioma%20ET%20Tribaldos%20Cuenca%20Espa%C3%B1a%202020%2005.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/Monometalito%20Tribaldos%2C%20visita%205%20enero%202021%2003_0.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/Monometalito%20Tribaldos%2C%20visita%205%20enero%202021%2006.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/Monometalito%20Tribaldos%2C%20visita%205%20enero%202021%2020_0.jpg https://monolithtracker.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/Tribaldos%20desde%20el%20cerro%20Ribagorda%2C%20donde%20fue%20instalado%20el%20Monometalito%20escrito%20en%20Klingon%20el%2021%20diciembre%202020.jpeg;39.972819;-2.90024;0;ezjgqhb4e983

It is the local mountain of Bad Staffelstein in the Upper Franconian district of Lichtenfels. The name of the elevation is derived from the distinctive terrain levels (""seasons""), which give an insightful insight into the geological history of the Jurassic period. From the Neolithic Age (around 5000 BC) to the Roman Empire (around 350 to 420 AD), the mountain was populated several times. During the La Tène period, the Celtic oppidum Menosgada was on the high plateau of the Staffelberg.

279;Seattle, United States;2021-02-12T01:53:49+00:00;2001-03-01;Exact;"<p>In Seattle a monolith was constructed in 2001 as a tribute to the classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey Monolith"" film.  The monolith was moved a few times, ending up in Interbay, Seattle.</p>
<p>The Monolith was fabricated by Louie Raffloer at Seattle's Black Dog Forge. It was a hollow structure measuring 1 by 4 by 9 feet (0.30 m × 1.2 m × 2.7 m), the same proportions as the Monoliths of the ""Space Odyssey"" series. </p>
<p>Initially, the artists creating the Monolith had the idea that the public would never know where the Monolith came from or who constructed it. That changed after the Monolith was removed from the park and found on Duck Island. Artist Caleb Schaber came forward as a spokesperson for Monolith announcing a group of artists named ""Some People"" were responsible for the art.</p>

La decisión la han tomado para evitar que se estropee la pieza, que no haya masificación en este lugar protegido o pase como en Platja d'Aro, donde primero unos jóvenes lo tiraron al suelo y después ha desaparecido de Parc de l'Estany donde lo habían trasladado. La pieza se instalará este miércoles en una plaza situada en la entrada del núcleo de Santas Creus.</p>

Authors also unknown. The authorities, obviously, do not know anything, if they are to go to collect their salary and that's it. Monometalite has good vibration, sound, and energy. It appears to be made of stainless steel. The metal plate is bent in a V and a second plate is welded on both sides. The welding and all the work is very professional, done with great skill. By resonating with the open hand, it produces the sound of a large, very low drum. The note is a Mi. It sounds identical to the Cuenca Monolith, in Castilla La Mancha.
