First excavations took place in 1932 and 1934, as Herzfeld worked for the Oriental Institute at Persepolis. In 1935 and 1937 Erich Friedrich Schmidt could make first aerial photographs, in which the size of the place in the 9th or 10 Century could be seen again.;52.90898604;29.9797278;0

Dehloran ?;Early Neolithic tell on the Deh Luran plain in lowland Khuzistan, western Iran. Excavated by Frank Hole and Kent Flannery in the 1960s, the work was innovative in successfully using a flotation unit to sample deposits for carbonized plant remains. The cultural sequence begins at about 8000 bc and runs through for about two millennia, spanning the period when farming developed in the region. In the earliest, Bus Mordeh, phase (c.8000-7000 BCE) the settlement comprised simple rectangular houses built of mud brick. The occupants lived through a combination of simple farming, hunting, and gathering. Domesticates included herded sheep and goats together with hulled barley, and emmer and einkorn wheat. The inhabitants collected a wide range of plants and also fished. In the succeeding Ali Kosh Phase (c.7000-6200 BCE) the same range of domesticates were found and some hunting and fishing still occurred, but the contribution made by wild plants decreased dramatically as the use of cultivated plants increased. The settlement was larger, with more substantial buildings. In the third, Muhammad Jaffar, phase (c.6200-5800 BCE) there were further innovations, including the introduction of pottery, and farming had become firmly established. The site appears to have been abandoned in the mid 6th millennium BCE.;47.32293399;32.6945364;0

Babylon;Akkadian city-state, the remains of which are found in present-day <i>Al Hillah</i>. The Babylonian state, along with Assyria to the north, was one of the two Akkadian nations that evolved after the collapse of the Akkadian Empire. All that remains of the original ancient city of Babylon today is a mound, or tell, of broken mud-brick buildings and debris in the fertile Mesopotamian plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The city itself was built upon the Euphrates, and divided in equal parts along its left and right banks, with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods.<br/>Available historical resources suggest that Babylon was at first a small town which had sprung up by the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC. The town flourished and attained prominence and political repute with the rise of the First Babylonian Dynasty. Claiming to be the successor of the ancient Eridu, Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the holy city of Mesopotamia around the time Hammurabi first unified the Babylonian Empire, and again became the seat of the Neo-Babylonian Empire from 612 to 539 BCE. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.;44.42284748;32.53773121;0

Nibru;"City in the middle of Sumer and center of the Enlil cult.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.history-book.net/images/Nippur1_large.jpg"" style=""float:right;margin-left:5px;""><img src=""http://www.history-book.net/images/Nippur1_large_tn.jpg""/></a>Nippur is one of the most ancient of all the Babylonian cities of which we have any knowledge (some historians date it back to 5262 BC) , revered cultic center, and seat of the worship to the Sumerian god, Enlil (ruler of the cosmos, subject to An alone) and housed the Ekur, temple of Enlil, leader of the pantheon. According to political ideology, all kings who exercised hegemony in southern Mesopotamia were seen as having been given the kingship by Enlil, and they showed their respect to him by building projects and dedicating war booty and cultic objects.Underscoring the city's religious purpose is this fact: in Sumerian cuneiform, the signs that translated as 'Nibru' and 'Enlil' are one and the same.One of the largest sites in Mesopotamia, Nippur covers about 150 hectares, measures over 1-1/2 km across, and rises as much as 20 kilometers above the plain. The site is divided in two by the dried bed of a watercourse. In addition to the Ekur complex, consisting of a ziggurat and temple to Enlil, are other temples, the most important of which is the Inanna/ Ishtar temple. Careful excavations here uncovered more than 20 building levels from the Middle Uruk (4000 BC) - Parthian (220 AD),  providing the longest continuous archaeological sequence for Mesopotamia. Small finds include statuary, plaques with carved reliefs, objects with relief decoration and cylinder seals, and foundation deposits,; while the cuneiform texts discovered detail the operation and bureaucratic administration of the temple complex. Many tablets were excavated in  an area of the eastern mound known as Tablet hill or the Scribal Quarter. As late as the Parthian period, the Inanna temple was rebuilt, and a fortress was built in the ziggurat area.(which could not be excavated further, as the Iraqi Dept of Antiquities wanted to leave the Parthian fortress standing).";45.23078534;32.12693858;0

Seleukia;"A major Hellenistic-era city and capital or the Seleucid and Parthian empires. The city was founded by Alexander the Great&#39;s calvary commander during the Eastern campaign, Seleucus Nicator (one of several Diodochi, or followers of Alexander who divided the empire among themselves after Alexander&#39;s death and esttablshed their dynasties. [The Hellenistic period, a flowering of art and culture extending from the Mediterranean to north Africa and Central Asia, took place during the two centuries following Alecander&#39;s death.]Along with Alexandria and Antioch in Syria, Seleucia became one of the three great Hellenistic-era capitals inteh East (the eastern capital of the Seleucids, later the western capital of the Parthians), with a cosmpolitan population of Greeks, Arameans, Syrians, etc. Excavators at this site were among the first to use ariel photography extensively; their photos reveal a precise grid plan, with blocks of housing separated by straight avenues and streets crossing at right angles. Artifacts uncovered at the site include numerous coins (some 30,000 specimens), pottery, clay figuines, and about 15,000 seal impressions or bullae (all in fully Greek style).Proof that cities during this period were often built and rebuilt from the rubble of previous civilizations was found in a brick that was used in the rebuilding of an outer wall during Parthian times: the brick was stamped with a mark datable to 821 BC during the Neo-Babylonian period.Architecturally, the city of Seleucia is known for decorative stucco (plaster), used in and about courtyards, important rooms and door entrances, combining motifs that are Greoc-Roman as well as  Eastern. The repeating rosette pattern was well suited for plaster work, and was adapted by the Parthians into the stucco grillwork that is a common feature today throughout the Middle East.";44.51748234;33.13365127;0

Tell Uqair;The site is known for its Uruk period architecture: a small tripartite temple with niched walls and an altar, set on an irregular platform not quite a ziggurat. The walls are adorned with polychrome paintings of powerful animals that decorate the altar: a pair of seated leopards in red and black, a bull and possibly a lion. There is also painted geometric decoration which imitates the colored mosaics found at the contemporary site of Uruk in a less expensive and labor intensive way. The paintings survived because the temple was later demolished and filled in with mud bricks so it could serve as the foundation for a still higher structure, and the bricks that it was packed with helped to preserve the paintings on the interior walls. The site is identified as Urum from very early  cuneiform texts from the subsequent Jemdet Nasr period.;44.66466778;32.7817058;0

Tutub;Occupied during the Early Dynastic Period, through the Sargonid Period, then came under the control of Eshnunna after the fall of the Ur III Empire. Later, after Eshnunna was captured by Babylon, a fort was built at the site by Samsu-iluna of the First Babylonian Dynasty and named Dur-Samsuiluna. The history of Tutub is known in somewhat more detail for a period of several decades as a result of the discovery of 112 tablets (one now lost) in a temple of Sin. The tablets constitute part of an official archive and include mostly loan and legal documents.<!-- Excavations revealed several levels of two temples which had been rebuilt:  a temple built to Sin, on flat ground., and the Oval Temple, which had two oval enclosure walls surrounding a temple platform (the actual structure on top of this has not survived). The outer wall is distorted somewhat in shape to accommodate a roomy structure, perhaps the house for a priest. Before the foundations for these walls had  been laid, the entire area was excavated to a depth of nearly five meters, and filled in with clean sand, about 64,000 cubic meters, presumably a purification ritual.Additionally, about 200 graves were excavated, mostly beneath the floors of  residential houses, ranging from simple shaft burials to walled tombs. The great quantity of pottery vessels recovered contributed to the stratigraphy the excavators developed for the Early Dynastic Period. -->;44.55581217;33.35464123;0

Ashnakkum;Chagar Bazar was already settled in the Neolithic. Excavations revealed pottery belonging to the Halaf and Ubaid cultures. By the Early Bronze Age, in the third millennium BCE, Chagar Bazar had turned into a small town with the size of 12 hectares. The site appears to have been abandoned by the end of the third millennium BCE. It was resettled by Hurrians in the Middle Bronze Age. Fine examples of the Khabur ware pottery dating to this period have been discovered by the excavators.;40.89783411;36.87574765;0

Tarbisu;Tarabisu was a minor town until the control of the Assyrian Empire was moved to nearby Nineveh by Sennacherib. Two palaces were built there, one by Esarhaddon for his son and crown prince, Ashurbanipal. Two temples were found at the site, one being the temple of Nergal, constructed by Sennacherib, and added to by Ashurbanipal. One of the gates in the northwest wall of Nineveh was named for Nergal and the road from that gate to Tarbisu was paved completely in stone by Sennacherib.Tarbisu was captured by the Medes, led by Cyaxares in the 12th year of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon and faded along with the Assyrian Empire.;43.07747422;36.40882297;0

Urkesh;"Urkesh was founded during the fourth millennium BCE possibly by the Hurrians on a site which appears to have been inhabited previously for a few centuries.Urkesh was an ally of the Akkadian Empire through what is believed to have been a dynastic marriage tradition. Tar&#39;am-Agade the daughter of the Akkadian king, Naram-Sin, is believed to have been married to the king of Urkesh. During the early second millennium BCE the city passed into the hands of the rulers of Mari, a city a few hundred miles to the south. The king of Urkesh became a vassal (and apparently an appointed puppet) of Mari. The people of Urkesh evidently resented this, as the royal archives at Mari provide evidence of their strong resistance; in one letter, the king of Mari tells his Urkesh counterpart that &quot;I did not know that the sons of your city hate you on my account. But you are mine, even if the city of Urkesh is not.&quot; In the middle of the millennium, Tell Mozan was the location of a Mitanni religious site. The city appears to have been largely abandoned circa 1350 BCE, but the reason for this is unknown to archaeologists at this time.";40.99693874;37.05697991;0

Euhemereia;Remains of this Graeco-Roman town include houses, a temple, granaries and two baths. The temple has been dated to the end of the first century BC to the beginning of the first century AD and was dedicated to Sobek and Isis. As in many other Graeco-Roman and Coptic sites in the Fayyum, several important finds of papyri have been made here, shedding light on the date and history of the town and its inhabitants.<br/>Today, only a few eroded mudbrick features and the remains of the two baths could be distinguished. The site is being threatened by the surrounding agricultural activities that are encroaching onto the site. The effects of the high water table and irrigation are visible not only along the borders of the site, but also within it. Dirt roads cross the site and it needs to be properly fenced off to protect it from further damage.;30.54304382;29.37367493;0

Tebtunis;"Tebtunis was founded by Amenemhat III around 1800 B.C. The town flourished during the Ptolemaic period and was famous for the many papyri in Demotic and Greek found there. These papyri give information about how people in Tebtunis lived from day to day. For example, one papyrus was found that gave &#39;minutes&#39; of a meeting of a group of priests. On this papyrus were the names of the priests, what the meeting was about, and a date - indicating that it was written during the Ptolemaic period. In Tebtunis, there were many Greek and Roman buildings. Tebtunis was a rich town and was a very important regional center during the Ptolemaic period.";30.76123986;29.10704576;0

Hatwaret;Ancient dwelling on the Pelusiac branch of the Nile that served as capital during various periods of Egyptian history.<br/>Avaris was later incorporated as the southern quarter into the city of Pi-Ramesse.<br/>The name (also spelled Auaris) originates from Egyptian Hatwaret, specifying an administrative capital (cf. Hawara at the entrance to the Faiyum).<br/>Avaris is the city where in the times of the Middle Kingdom the main settlements of the Habiru in Egypt were situated (the biblical Goshen).<br/>It should be noted that many (older) works erroneously identify Avaris with Tanis.<br/>The place where Avaris was unearthed is today called Tell ed-Daba.;31.82221773;30.78629566;0

Pi-Atum;"The location of Pithom has been the subject of much conjecture and debate. In the spring of 1883 &#201;douard Naville  believed he had identified it as the archaeological site Tell-el-Maskhuta. The site of Pithom, as identified by Naville, is to the east of Wadi Tumilat, south-west of Isma&#239;lia. Here was formerly a group of granite statues representing Ramesses II, two inscriptions naming Pr-Itm, storehouses and bricks made without straw. The excavations carried on by Naville for the Egypt Exploration Fund  uncovered a city wall, a ruined temple, and the remains of a series of brick buildings with very thick walls and consisting of rectangular chambers of various sizes, opening only at the top and without any entrances to one another. Naville identified it as being in the region of Tjeku, the capital of the 8th Lower Egypt nome. Excavations carried out over five seasons between 1978 and 1985 have shown that Tell el-Maskhuta dates only to the end of the 7th century, and may have been built by Pharaoh Necho II, possibly as part of his uncompleted canal building project from the Nile to the Gulf of Suez.";32.0991265;30.55210858;0

Beth-Pelet;"Tell el-Far'ah (South) is close to an ancient route connecting Egypt with Syria and Mesopotamia. Situated along the Nahal Besor, the site lies on the border of the arid zone. This position between the desert and the sown characterizes the importance of Tell el-Far'ah. At the periphery of empires and regional states, the site was instrumental in administrating economic and political contacts with the pastoral people to its south.<br/><br/>In addition to its regional importance, the site often served the needs of ancient empires such as Egypt, Assyria, or the Achaemenids. The area was an interface of the geopolitical interests of Egypt and the ancient Near Eastern continental empires. These continental empires had to struggle with opposition forces at their periphery which formed coalitions against the center. Such events were already a deadly threat to these empires and their activities against these coalitions at the periphery constitute a structural pattern in their policies.<br/><br/>source: <a href=""http://farahsouth.cgu.edu/index.htm"">Israel Excavation Project</a>";34.48253219;31.28204041;0

Akhetaten;"The city was built as the new capital of the Pharaoh Akhenaten, dedicated to his new religion of worship to the Aten. Construction started in or around Year 5 of his reign and was probably completed by Year 9, although it became the capital city two years earlier. To speed up construction of the city most of the buildings were constructed out of mud-brick, and white washed. The most important buildings were faced with local stone.It is the only ancient Egyptian city which preserves great details of its internal plan, in large part because the city was abandoned after the death of Akhenaten. The city seems to have remained active for a decade or so after his death, and a shrine to Horemheb indicates that it was at least partially occupied at the beginning of his reign, if only as a source for building material elsewhere. Once it was abandoned it remained uninhabited until Roman settlement began along the edge of the Nile. However, due to the unique circumstances of its creation and abandonment, it is questionable how representative of ancient Egyptian cities it actually is. Akhetaten was hastily constructed and covered an area of approximately 13 km of territory on the east bank of the Nile River; on the west bank, land was set aside to provide crops for the city&#39;s population. The entire city was encircled with a total of 14 boundary stelae detailing Akhenaten&#39;s conditions for the establishment of this new capital city of Egypt.";30.89624244;27.64528963;0

Arsur;The town was settled by Phoenicians in the 6th or 5th century BC, and named Arshuf after Resheph, the Canaanite god of fertility and the underworld. It was then a part of the Persian Empire and governed from Sidon. Phoenicians of Arshuf produced precious purple dye, derived from murex mollusks, which they exported to the Aegean. During the Hellenistic period it was an anchorage town, ruled by Seleucids and re-named Apollonia, as the Greeks identified Reshef with Apollo. Under Roman rule, the size of the town increased. It was an important settlement between Jaffa and Caesarea along Via Maris, the coastal road. In 113 AD, Apollonia was destroyed partially by an earthquake, but recovered quickly. The harbor was built, and trade with Italy and North Africa developed.;34.80721338;32.19512453;0

Bet-el;"<p>beth'-el (beth-'el; Baithel and oikos theou, literally, &quot;house of God&quot;):</p><p>(1) A town near the place where Abraham halted and offered sacrifice on his way south from Shechem.</p><p>1. Identification and Description:</p><p>It lay West of Ai (Ge 12:8). It is named as on the northern border of Benjamin (the southern of Ephraim, Jos 16:2), at the top of the ascent from the Jordan valley by way of Ai (Jos 18:13). It lay South of Shiloh (Jud 21:19). Eusebius, Onomasticon places it 12 Roman miles from Jerusalem, on the road to Neapolis. It is represented by the modern Beitin, a village of some 400 inhabitants, which stands on a knoll East of the road to Nablus. There are four springs which yield supplies of good water. In ancient times these were supplemented by a reservoir hewn in the rock South of the town. The surrounding country is bleak and barren, the hills being marked by a succession of stony terraces, which may have suggested the form of the ladder in Jacob's famous dream.</p><p>2. The Sanctuary:</p><p>The town was originally called Luz (Ge 28:19, etc.). When Jacob came hither on his way to Paddan-aram we are told that he lighted upon &quot;the place&quot; (Ge 28:11. Hebrew). The Hebrew maqom, like the cognate Arabic maqam, denotes a sacred place or sanctuary. The maqom was doubtless that at which Abraham had sacrificed, East of the town. In the morning Jacob set up &quot;for a pillar&quot; the stone which had served as his pillow (Ge 28:18; see PILLAR, matstsebhah), poured oil upon it and called the name of the place Bethel, &quot;house of God&quot;; that is, of God whose epiphany was for him associated with the pillar. This spot became a center of great interest, lending growing importance to the town. In process of time the name Luz disappeared, giving place to that of the adjoining sanctuary, town and sanctuary being identified. Jacob revisited the place on his return from Paddan-aram; here Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under &quot;the oak&quot; (Ge 35:6 f). Probably on rising ground East of Bethel Abraham and Lot stood to view the uninviting highlands and the rich lands of the Jordan valley (Ge 13:9 ff).</p><p>3. History:</p><p>Bethel was a royal city of the Canaanites (Jos 12:16). It appears to have been captured by Joshua (8:7), and it was allotted to Benjamin (Jos 18:22). In Jud 1:22 ff it is represented as held by Canaanites, from whom the house of Joseph took it by treachery (compare 1Ch 7:28). Hither the ark was brought from Gilgal (Jud 2:1, Septuagint). Israel came to Bethel to consult the Divine oracle (Jud 20:18), and it became an important center of worship (1Sa 10:3). The home of the prophetess Deborah was not far off (Jud 4:5). Samuel visited Bethel on circuit, judging Israel (1Sa 7:16).</p><p>With the disruption of the kingdom came Bethel's greatest period of splendor and significance. To counteract the influence of Jerusalem as the national religious center Jeroboam embarked on the policy which won for him the unenviable reputation of having &quot;made Israel to sin.&quot; Here he erected a temple, set up an image, the golden calf, and established an imposing ritual. It became the royal sanctuary and the religious center of his kingdom (1Ki 12:29 ff; Am 7:13). He placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made (1Ki 12:32). To Bethel came the man of God from Judah who pronounced doom against Jeroboam (1Ki 13), and who, having been seduced from duty by an aged prophet in Bethel, was slain by a lion. According to the prophets Amos and Hosea the splendid idolatries of Bethel were accompanied by terrible moral and religious degradation. Against the place they launched the most scathing denunciations, declaring the vengeance such things must entail (Am 3:14; 4:4; 5:11 m; Am 9:1; Ho 4:15; 5:8; 10:5,8,15). With the latter the name Bethel gives place in mockery to Beth-aven. Bethel shared in the downfall of Samaria wrought by the Assyrians; and according to an old tradition, Shalmaneser possessed himself of the golden calf (compare Jer 48:13). The priest, sent by the Assyrians to teach the people whom they had settled in the land how to serve Yahweh, dwelt in Bethel (2Ki 17:28). King Josiah completed the demolition of the sanctuary at Bethel, destroying all the instruments of idolatry, and harr ying the tombs of the idolaters. The monument of the man of God from Judah he allowed to stand (2Ki 23:4,25). The men of Bethel were among those who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (Ezr 2:28; Ne 7:32), and it is mentioned as reoccupied by the Benjamites (Ne 11:31). Zechariah (Zec 7:2) records the sending of certain men from Jerusalem in the 4th year of King Darius to inquire regarding particular religious practices. Bethel was one of the towns fortified by Bacchides in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc 9:50; Ant, XIII, i, 3). It is named again as a small town which, along with Ephraim, was taken by Vespasian as he approached Jerusalem (BJ, IV, ix, 9).</p><p>W. Ewing</p>";35.23997219;31.92186153;0

Oboda;The remains of a Nabateans road station for their caravans, is located on a mountain in the center of the Negev Desert on the road from Petra and Eilat.<br/><br/>Avdat (in Greek: Oboda) was a seasonal camping ground for Nabataean caravans travelling along the early Petra - Gaza road (the Darb es-Sultan) in the 3rd - late 2nd c. BCE. The town was Avdat was founded at the site in the late 1st century BCE and named after the Nabatean King Obodas who was revered as a deity and, according to tradition, was buried there (hence the name in Arabic: Abdah). Before the end of the 1st c. BCE a temple platform (the acropolis) was created along the western edge of the plataeu. Recent excavations have shown that the town continued to be inhabited by the Nabataeans continiously from this period until its destruction by earthquake in the early seventh c.

Shiloh;"A town in the lot of Ephraim where Israel assembled under Joshua at the close of the war of conquest (Jos 18:1). Here territory was allotted to the seven tribes who had not yet received their portions. A commission was sent out to &quot;describe the land into seven portions&quot;; this having been done, the inheritances were assigned by lot. Here also were assigned to the Levites their cities in the territories of the various tribes (Joshua 18-21). From Shiloh Reuben and Gad departed for their homes East of the Jordan; and here the tribes gathered for war against these two, having misunderstood their building of the great altar in the Jordan valley (Joshua 22). From Jud 18:31 we learn that in the period of the Judges the house of God was in Shiloh; but when the sanctuary was moved thither from Gilgal there is no indication. The maids of Shiloh were captured by the Benjamites on the occasion of a feast, while dancing in the vineyards; this having been planned by the other tribes to provide the Benjamites with wives without involving themselves in responsibility (21:21 ff). While the house of the Lord remained here it was a place of pilgrimage (1Sa 1:3). To Shiloh Samuel was brought and consecrated to God's service (1Sa 1:24). The sanctuary was presided over by Eli and his wicked sons; and through Samuel the doom of their house was announced. The capture of the ark by the Philistines, the fall of Hophni and Phinehas, and the death of the aged priest and his daughter-in-law followed with startling rapidity (1Sa 3; 4). The sanctuary in Shiloh is called a &quot;temple&quot; (1Sa 1:9; 3:3) with doorpost and doors (1Sa 1:9; 3:15). It was therefore a more durable structure than the old tent.It would appear to have been destroyed, probably by the Philistines; and we find the priests of Eli's house at Nob, where they were massacred at Saul's order (1Sa 22:11 ). The disaster that befell Shiloh, while we have no record of its actual occurrence, made a deep impression on the popular mind, so that the prophets could use it as an effective illustration (Ps 78:60; Jer 7:12:14; 26:6). Here the blind old prophet Ahijah was appealed to in vain by Jeroboam's wife on behalf of her son (1Ki 14:2,4), and it was still occupied in Jeremiah's time (Jer 41:5).<br/><br/>The position of Shiloh is indicated in Jud 21:19, as &quot;on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.&quot; This is very explicit, and points definitely to Seilun, a ruined site on a hill at the Northeast of a little plain, about 9 miles North of Beitin (Bethel), and 3 miles Southeast of Khan el-Lubban (Lebonah), to the East of the highway to Shechem (Nablus). The path to Seilun leaves the main road at Sinjil, going eastward to Turmus `Aya, then northward across the plain. A deep valley runs to the North of the site, cutting it off from the adjoining hills, in the sides of which are rock-hewn tombs. A good spring rises higher up the valley. There are now no vineyards in the district; but indications of their ancient culture are found in the terraced slopes around.<br/><br/>The ruins on the hill are of comparatively modern buildings. At the foot of the hill is a mosque which is going quickly to ruin. A little distance to the Southeast is a building which seems to have been a synagogue. It is called by the natives Jami` el-`Arba`in, &quot;mosque of the Forty.&quot; There are many cisterns.<br/><br/>Just over the crest of the hill to the North, on a terrace, there is cut in the rock a rough quadrangle 400 ft. by 80 ft. in dimensions. This may have been the site of &quot;the house of the Lord&quot; which was in Shiloh.<br/><br/>W. Ewing";35.28957761;32.05600115;0

Ziph ?;"A town in the hill country of Judah, mentioned along with Maon, Carmel and Jutah (Jos 15:55). It is chiefly celebrated in connection with the earlier history of David: &quot;David .... remained in the hill-country in the wilderness of Ziph&quot; (1Sa 23:14,15,24; 26:2); the Ziphites (1Sa 23:19; 26:1; compare Ps 54 title) sought to betray him to Saul, but David escaped. Ziph was fortified by Rehoboam (2Ch 11:8). The name also occurs in 1Ch 2:42; 4:16. In connection with this last (compare 4:23) it is noticeable that Ziph is one of the four names occurring on the Hebrew stamped jar handles with the added la-melekh, &quot;to the king.&quot; The site is Tell Zif, 4 miles Southeast of Hebron, conspicuous hill 2,882 ft. above sea-level; there are cisterns and, to the East, some ruins (PEF, III, 312, 315).";35.13363649;31.48327955;0

Anemourion;"Founded by the Phoenicians, the city was then occupied by the Assyrians and Hittites. During the Hittite period in the twelfth century BCE, the ruler Tuthalia IV, granted Anemorium to Mattuvata who had taken refuge in his kingdom. Mattuvata took advantage of the Hittites&#39; weakness, establishing his own kingdom with Anemorium as its capital. His rule extended as far as Afyon, in central Anatolia. At the end of the 12th century BCE the area was occupied by a nomadic tribe that had come from across the Caucasus mountains. The tribe was called by the ancient Greeks the &quot;Wind people&quot; after whom the city was named. The exact reasons behind this name are lost in time.The most probable explanation however, is that they worshiped a god of wind, perhaps similar to the Greek Aeolus, as their main deity. Then the city came under the control of the Phoenicians again, and later Persians. In 333 BCE Alexander the Great brought this coast within his Macedonian Empire, and he was succeeded by Seleucids and then Ancient Romans. The coast was given by Mark Anthony to Cleopatra as a wedding present and Roman coins have been discovered in the course of excavation, dating to the years between Emperors Titus (79-81 CE) and Valevianus (253-259 CE). The Romans were succeeded by the Byzantines.";32.80303916;36.0225213;0

Bing?l;"The history goes back quite far, which is typical for this region. Bing&amp;ouml;l successively came under the rule of various empires. It was a part of the kingdom of Urartu. The Assyrian king Assurbanipal conquered Bing&amp;ouml;l 660 BCE. In the 7th Century BCE Bing&amp;ouml;l became part of the Persian Empire. The Persians were replaced by the Seleucids. 60 BCE the Romans conquered the territory of the Arsacids. In 395 BCE Bing&amp;ouml;l was part of Byzantium, who ruled here intermittently until the Arab invasion in 634 BCE.After the Islamization of the region in the 13th Century Turkish Emirates were established. One of them was the Rum Seljuks, that conquered Bing&amp;ouml;l in 1230 CE. In 1243 CE the Ilkhanate conquered the area after they had defeated the Rum-Seljuks. The Ilkhanate was  followed by Aq Qoyunlu and subsequently by the the Safavids. The Safavids were defeated in 1515 by the Ottomans.";40.4972223;38.88684881;0

Degirmentepe ?;"The first settlement of the mound; located on the bank of Euphrates (40 m from the river in the present time); was founded on a natural conglomeratic elevation near the river. It is interpreted that the elevation was near the river during the first inhabitation; and the inhabitants used the Euphrates as a water source. Before the inundation; the mound was 12 m high above the level of the river bank; and 4.5 m high above the level of the southern road. It was 125 m wide in the north-south direction; 200 m long in the east-west direction; and looked like a &quot;8&quot; shaped; medium mound. The northern section ends with a steep slope at the fields near Euphrates; while the southern section is slightly sloped towards the road. Before the excavation; no damage was observed besides ploughing; and the overflowing of Euphrates. The mound used to be located on a narrow plain surrounded by fertile fields near Euphrates.<br/>The mound is flooded by dam reservoir.";38.46702247;38.45941928;0

Habesos;"Although the Teke peninsula has been occupied since the stone age it seems Kas was founded by the Lycians, and its name in Lycian language was Habesos or Habesa. It was a member of the Lycian League, and its importance during this time is confirmed by the presence of one of the richest Lycian necropolis.The ancient Greeks later gave it the name of Antiph&#233;llos or Ant&#237;philos, since it was the harbor in front of the city of Phellos. During the Roman period, Antiph&#233;llos was famous for exporting sponges and timber. Pliny the Elder refers to the town in the fifth book of his Naturalis Historia. After 395 CE the town became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) and during the early Middle Ages was a bishop&#39;s see - and as Antiphellus is still a titular see.";29.63473941;36.2004143;0

Phaselis;The town was set up by the Rhodians in 700 BCE. Because of its location on an isthmus separating two harbours, it became the most important harbour city of the western Lycia and an important centre of commerce between Greece, Asia, Egypt, and Phoenicia, although it did not belong to the Lycian League. The city was captured by Persians after they conquered Asia Minor, and was later captured by Alexander the Great.After the death of Alexander, the city remained in Egyptian hands from 209 BCE to 197 BCE, under the dynasty of Ptolemaios, and with the conclusion of the Apamea treaty, was handed over to the Kingdom of Rhodes, together with the other cities of Lycia. From 190 BCE to 160 BCE it remained under Rhodeian hegemony, but after 160 BCE it was absorbed into the Lycian confederacy under Roman rule. Phaselis, like Olympos, was under constant threat from pirates in the 1st century BCE, and the city was even taken over by the pirate Zekenites for a period until his defeat by the Romans. In 42 BCE Brutus had the city linked to Rome. During the Byzantine period, the city became a bishopric, although in the 3rd century CE, its convenient harbor had fallen under the threat of pirates once again.;30.55216485;36.52378894;0

Sagalassos;"Human settlement in the area goes back to 8000 BCE, before the actual site was occupied. Hittite documents refer to a mountain site of Salawassa in the fourteenth century BCE and the town spread during the Phrygian and Lydian cultures. Sagalassos was part of the region of Pisidia in the western part of the Taurus Mountains. During the Persian period, Pisidia became known for its warlike factions.Sagalassos was one of the wealthiest cities in Pisidia when Alexander the Great conquered it in 333 BCE on his way to Persia. It had a population of a few thousand. After Alexander&#39;s death, the region became part of territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, the Seleucids of Syria and the Attalids of Pergamon. Archeological record indicates that locals rapidly adopted Hellenic culture.The Roman Empire absorbed Pisidia after the Attalids and it became part of province of Asia. In 39 BCE it was handed out to Galatian client king Amyntas but after he was killed in 25 BCE, Rome turned Pisidia into the province of Galatia. Under the Roman Empire, Sagalassos became the important urban center of Pisidia, particularly favoured by the Emperor Hadrian, who named it the &quot;first city&quot; of the province and the center of the imperial cult. Contemporary buildings have a fully Roman character.";30.51874496;37.67594181;0

Adummatu;The city has a history dating back to the 10th century BC and is mentioned in Akkadian inscriptions of the Assyrian empire dating to 845 BC in which it is referred to as Adummatu and is described as the capital of an Arab kingdom, sometimes named as Qedar (Qidri). The names of five powerful Arab queens that ruled this city are known, among them Zabibe, Samsi, Tabua and Te'elhunu. The latter is also given the title of high priestess of Atarsamain, a deity of fertility, love and war associated with Ishtar. Dumat al-Jundal was the site of an important temple dedicated to Ishtar.<br/>In 106 AD, Dumatha was incorporated into the Roman Empire when the Emperor Trajan defeated the Nabataeans. Dumatha remained integral to the Limes Arabicus for over four centuries, serving as the easternmost settlement along the limes. In 269 CE, the place was mentioned by Zenobia, the Queen of Palmyra, as city with an immune fortress. After her forces had captured the city, the fortress of Marid withstood the attack in her revolt against the Romans. Later in the 5th century CE, the city became the capital of the kingdom of Kindah. In 633 CE, Khalid ibn al-Walid captured Dumat Al-Jandal and it became a part of the newly formed Islamic empire.;39.86711562;29.81134313;0

Kameiros;"The ancient city was built on three levels. At the top of the hill was the Acropolis, with the temple complex of Athena Kameiras and the Stoa. A covered reservoir having a capacity of 600 cubic meters of water was constructed about the sixth century BCE. Later, the Stoa was built over the reservoir. The Stoa consisted of two rows of Doric columns with rooms for shops or lodgings in the rear.The main settlement was on the middle terrace, consisting of a grid of parallel streets and residential blocks. On the lower terrace are found a Doric Temple, probably to Apollo; the Fountain House, with the Agora in front of it; and Peribolos of the Altars, which contained dedications to various deities.During the prehistoric period the area was inhabited by Mycenaean Greeks. The city itself was founded by the Dorians. The temple foundations were begun at least as early as the eighth century BC. The earthquake of 226 BCE destroyed the city and the temple. The earthquake of 142 BCE destroyed the city for the second time.";27.92119093;36.33640155;0

Mende;Mende was probably built during the 9th century BCE by Eretrian colonists. The city owes its name to the plant minthe, a species of mint that still sprouts in the area. The large quantities of lumber that produced, the silver, gold and lead mines that possessed led Mende in rapid development and from the 6th century BCE was one of the cities that controlled trade routes in the coast of Thrace with confirmed dealings even to the Greek colonies in Italy, specially cause the exports of the famous local wine Mendaeos oinos.During the 5th century BCE, Mende became one of the most important allies to Athens by participating in the Delian League paying a tax that varied from six up to fifteen Attic talents per year. However, in 423 BCE managed to acquire its sovereign, nevertheless this situation did not last long for the Athenians quickly suppressed the revolt. During the Peloponnesian War, Mende, Toroni and Skione were the main goals of the two combattants, Athenians and Spartans, in the area, specially after Brasidas,the Spartan general, raised an army of allies and helots and went for the sources of Athenian power in north Greece in 424 BCE. After the end of the war, Mende reacquired its independence.The city tried to avoid Olynthian rule in the 4th century BCE, when the Chalkidician League was established and later the Macedonian hegemony, but in 315 BCE its population, among with other Chalkidicians, was forced to resettle in Cassandreia, after this new city was built were Poteidaea stood by king Cassander.In Mende was born the sculptor Paeonius who made the statue of Nike which was put on top of the victory pillar in Olympia, and is presented in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia.;23.37481116;40.46756741;0

Roussolakkos;The earliest written records documenting the worship of Diktaian Zeus at Roussolakkos come from the Mycenaean Greek Linear B archives at Knossos and date to the close of the Cretan Bronze Age (ca. 1300 BCE), however, sacred art and architecture dating from all periods have been found, suggesting that the site was hallowed throughout its history. Among the most beautiful artifacts attesting the worship of Diktaian Zeus is a unique gold and ivory statuette of the god made ca. 1500 BC.

Akanthos;"The town was founded by 7th century BCE (the archaeology suggests 655 BCE) by colonists from Andros, according to Thucydides. Plutarch, on the other hand, referred to it as a mixed colony of Andrians and local Chalcidians, which was founded on the &quot;Coast of Drakontos&quot;, in place of a preexisting civilization. He writes that settlers from Andros and Chalcis arrived on the shore at the same time. The natives of Acanthus, seeing the crowd of settlers, became frightened and left the city. The settlers sent an explorer each to see what had happened and, as they approached the city and realized it was empty, ran to be the first to take over the land for their fellow countrymen. The Chalcidian was the fastest but the Andrian, seeing he was losing, stopped and threw his spear on the wall&#39;s gate, before his opponent arrived. A court case followed, which was won by the Andrians, because as they protested, they had just about taken over the city first.";23.87802824;40.39998791;0

Apollonia of Mygdonia ?;"ap-o-lo'-ni-a (Apollonia): A town in Mygdonia, a district in Macedonia. It was situated a little to the south of Lake Bolbe, on the Via Egnatia, the great Roman road leading from the coast of the Adriatic to the river Hebrus (Maritza), one of the main military and commercial highways of the empire: it lay between Amphipolis and Thessalonica, a day's journey (Livy xlv.28) or about 30 Roman miles from the former and 38 from the latter. The foundation of the town may perhaps be attributed to about 432 BC; in any case, coins are extant which attest its existence in the 4th century BC (Head, Historia Numorum, 181). Paul and Silas passed through the town on their journey from Philippi to Thessalonica, but do not appear to have stayed there (Acts 17:1). The name seems to have survived in the modern Pollina (Leake, Northern Greece, III, 458; Cousinery, Voyage dans la Macedoine, I, 115).<br/>from International Standard Bible Encyclopedia";23.48576313;40.6389467;0

Heraclea Lyncestis;"Founded by Philip II of Macedon in the middle of the 4th century BCE, after he had conquered the surrounding region of Lynkestis and incorporated it into his kingdom of Macedon. The city was named in honor of the mythological Greek hero Heracles. The epithet Lynkestis means &quot;the Land of the Lynx&quot; in Greek.Heraclea was a strategically important town during the Hellenistic period, as it was at the edge of Macedon&#39;s border with Epirus to the west, and to the non-Greek world to the north, until the middle of the 2nd century BCE, when the Romans conquered Macedon and destroyed its political power. The Romans divided Macedonia into 4 regions and Heraclea was in the fourth region. The main Roman road in the area, Via Egnatia went through Heraclea, and Heraclea was an important stop. The prosperity of the city was maintained mainly due to this road. Objects discovered from the time of Roman rule in Heraclea are: Votive monuments, a portico, thermae (baths), a theatre and town walls. In the early Christian period, Heraclea was an important Episcopal seat. Some of its bishops are mentioned in synods in Serdica and other nearby towns. From this period are the ensembles of the Small and Great (Large, Big) basilica. The Grave (Funeral) basilica with a necropolis is located east of the theatre.";21.34266109;41.01133607;0

Kition;"Founded by Greeks (Mycenaean-Achaeans) in the 14th century BCE and was known as Kition. The biblical name Kittim, though derived from Citium, was generally used for Cyprus as a whole and occasionally by the Jews for the Greeks and Romans. Larnaca is colloquially known as &quot;Skala&quot; meaning &quot;ladder&quot; or &quot;landing stage&quot;, referring to the town&#39;s status in history as an important port.Like most Cypriote cities, Kition belonged to the Persian or Achaemenid Empire. In 450 BCE, the Athenian general Cimon, died at sea defending the city of Citium in a major battle with the Persians. On his deathbed, he urged his officers to conceal his death from both their allies and the Persians. The quote &quot;Even in death he was victorious&quot; refers to Kimon. A statue of &quot;Kimon the Athenian&quot; stands proudly on the sea front promenade of modern Larnaca.";33.63051684;34.92320116;0

Akra Leuke;"The area around Alicante has been inhabited for over 7000 years, with the first tribes of hunter gatherers moving down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BCE. Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of Mount Benacantil. By 1000 BCE Greek and Phoenician traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron and the pottery wheel. By the 3rd century BCE, the rival armies of Carthage and Rome began to invade and fight for control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca established the fortified settlement of Akra Leuka (meaning &quot;White Mountain&quot; or &quot;White Point&quot;), where Alicante stands today.Although the Carthaginians conquered much of the land around Alicante, the Romans would eventually rule Hispania Tarraconensis for over 700 years. By the 5th century CE, Rome was in decline and the Roman predecessor town of Alicante, known as Lucentum, was more or less under the control of the Visigothic warlord Theudimer.";-0.43839889;38.3646323;0

Aikai;"According to legend, Aecae was founded by the Greek hero Diomedes, who had destroyed the ancient Troy.Aecae was mentioned both by Polybius and Livy, during the military operations of Hannibal and Fabius Maximus in Apulia. In common with many other Apulian cities it had joined the Carthaginians after the battle of Cannae, but was recovered by Fabius Maximus in 214 BCE, though not without a regular siege. Pliny also enumerates the Aecani among the inland towns of Apulia; but its position is more clearly determined by the Itineraries, which place it on the Appian Way between Equus Tuticus and Herdonia, at a distance of 18 or 19 miles from the latter city. This interval exactly accords with the position of the modern city of Troia, and confirms the statements of several chroniclers of the Middle Ages, that the latter was founded about the beginning of the eleventh century, on the ruins of the ancient Aecae.";15.308221;41.36100612;0
Akeru;Acerra is one of the most ancient cities of the region, probably founded by the Osci with the name of Akeru (Latin: Acerrae).

Its establishment took place around 582-580 BCE and is attributed to Dorian colonists from Gela, who named it Akragas.Akragas grew rapidly, becoming one of the richest and most famous of the Greek colonies of Magna Graecia. It came to prominence under the 6th-century tyrants Phalaris and Theron, and became a democracy after the overthrow of Theron&#39;s son Thrasydaeus. Although the city remained neutral in the conflict between Athens and Syracuse, its democracy was overthrown when the city was sacked by the Carthaginians in 406 BC. Akragas never fully recovered its former status, though it revived to some extent under Timoleon in the latter part of the 4th century.";13.58427204;37.29082765;0

Akrai;The area around Palazzolo Acreide was settled by humans since very ancient times. In the 11th-10th centuries BCE the Siculi lived here in small villages. The town occupies the site of the ancient Akrai (Latin Acrae), founded by Syracuse about 664 BCE. The city was important as it controlled the paths of communication with the towns on the southern coast of the island. According to Thucydides, the Syracusans defeated the Athenians here in 413 BC.In the treaty between the Romans and Hiero II of Syracuse in 263 BCE it was assigned to the latter. After the Roman conquest, it became a civitas stipendiaria, and was still prospering in the course of the early Christian age.;14.89451604;37.05721858;0

Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy also cite the town. The rich votive furnishing from the two extensive necropoleis attest to the importance of Vetulonia&#39;s elite.The so called Mura dell&#39;Arce (cyclopean walls) date probably from the 6th-5th century BCE, and aerial photography has revealed further stretches, which show the political and commercial importance of Vetulonia, which was famous for its goldsmiths.

Cirta;Cirta was the capital city of the ancient Berber kingdom of Numidia in northern Africa (modern Algeria). Its strategically important port city was Russicada. Although Numidia was a key ally of the ancient Roman Republic during the Punic Wars (264 BC-146 BCE), Cirta was subject to Roman invasions during the 1st and 2nd centuries BCE, eventually falling under Roman dominion during the rule of Julius Caesar. The city was destroyed in the beginning of the 4th century and was rebuilt by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, who gave his name to the newly constructed city, Constantine.;6.61246922;36.36735488;0

Kondoa Irangi Rock Paintings ?;"The Kondoa Irangi Rock Paintings are located along the Maasai Escarpment bordering the Great Rift Valley. The rock painting is spread out over a wide area within Kondoa district. The exact boarders of the proposed World Heritage site have not been determined yet, but will be drawn up in consultation with all stakeholders during the management planning process that accompanies the nomination dossier. The rock art found at these sites is the northern-most extension of the southern African hunter-gatherer rock art tradition. It comes primarily from the hunter-gatherer period with red pigment in the outline, streaky, and silhouette styles. Subject matter ranges from animals significant to the cosmology of the artists to human figures in a variety of postures, and non-figurative designs. Giraffe, eland, and elephants predominate. Art can also be found from the more recent agriculturist period. These so-called &quot;late whites&quot; are usually finger paintings of abstract designs and more occasionally of humans and animals.";35.82050694;-4.72343198;0

Mistikawy Cave ?;Discovered by Ahmed Al-Mistikawy is the senior guide of Zarzora Expedition in 2002, the rock-art site of Mistikawy Cave, in northwest Gilf Kebir, is yet to be studied. Due to its remoteness, the site, like several other prehistoric remains, has been visited by only few hundreds of people. Most of those were tourists with general interest in rock-art. however, systematic examination requires sincere efforts, well-fitted logistics and precious time. Zarzora Expedition has led several trips to the area and recently began to document the drawings and look for other, believed to exist, Neolithic shelters.;25.16674082;23.65932825;0

Mahabodhi;"Buddhist temple, the location where Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, is said to have attained enlightenment.Traditional accounts say that, around 530 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama, a young Indian Prince who saw the suffering of the world and wanted to end it, reached the sylvan banks of Falgu River, near the city of Gaya, India. There he sat in meditation under a peepul tree, which later became known as the Bodhi tree. According to Buddhist scriptures, after three days and three nights, Siddharta attained enlightenment and the answers that he had sought.In approximately 250 BCE, about 200 years after the Buddha attained enlightenment, Buddhist Emperor Asoka visited Bodh Gaya with the intention of establishing a monastery and shrine. As part of the temple, he built the diamond throne (called the Vajrasana), attempting to mark the exact spot of the Buddha&#39;s enlightenment, was established. Asoka is considered the founder of the Mahabodhi Temple. The present temple dates from the 5th-6th century CE.";84.99152169;24.695898;0

Anuradhapura;Anuradhapura is one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka, famous for its well-preserved ruins of ancient Lankan civilization.<br/>Although according to historical records the city was founded in the 5th century BC, the archaeological data put the date as far back as the 10th century BCE. Very little evidence was available about the period before the 5th century BCE, though excavations have revealed information about the earlier inhabitants of the city.<br/>Further excavations in Anuradhapura have uncovered information about the existence of a protohistoric habitation of humans in the citadel. The protohistoric Iron Age which spans from 900 to 600 BCE, marked the appearance of iron technology, pottery, the horse, domestic cattle and paddy cultivation. In the time period 700 to 600 BCE the settlement in Anuradhapura had grown over an area of at least 50 ha. The city was strategically situated of major ports northwest and northeast, it was surrounded by irrigable and fertile land. The city was also buried deep in the jungle providing natural defence from invaders.<br/>The Lower Early Historic period, spanning from 500 to 250 BC, is studied on the lines of the chronicles. During this time King Pandukabhaya formally planned the city, with gates, quarters for traders etc. The city at the time would have covered an area of 1 square kilometre which makes it one of the largest in the continent at the time.;80.40233315;8.34974532;0

Abbotsbury Castle;An Iron Age hill fort situated on Wears Hill above the village of Abbotsbury. The fort was occupied by the Celtic Durotriges tribe and was situated on a high chalk hill overlooking the English Channel, making it the front line of defence from invasion. When the Romans invaded in AD 43, the second Augustian legion of Vespasian took the fort quickly with little struggle before moving on to Maiden Castle. There is no evidence that the Romans settled at Abbotsbury Castle as they did at some other hill forts.;-2.6300255;50.67715679;0

Aquae Sulis;"The Romans probably occupied Aquae Sulis shortly after their invasion of Britain in AD 43, attracted by the large natural hot spring which had been a shrine of the Celtic Brythons, dedicated to their goddess, Sulis. This spring was a natural mineral spring found in the valley of the Avon River in Southwest England. The name is Latin for &quot;the waters of Sulis.&quot; The Romans identified the goddess with their goddess Minerva and encouraged her worship. The similarities between Minerva and Sulis helped the Celts adapt to Roman culture. The spring was built up into a major Roman Baths complex associated with an adjoining temple. About 130 messages to Sulis scratched onto lead curse tablets (defixiones) have been recovered from the Sacred Spring by archaeologists.";-2.35999337;51.38093049;0

Eboracum (colonia) ?;The Roman conquest of Britain began in 43 CE but advance beyond the Humber did not take place until the early 70s CE. This was because the people in the area known as the Brigantes by the Romans became a Roman client state.

Eboracum was founded in 71 CE when Cerialis and the Ninth Legion constructed a military fortress (castra) on flat ground above the River Ouse near its junction with the River Foss. In the same year Cerialis was appointed Governor of Britain.;-1.08653679;53.95831131;0

Sutton Hoo;"Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England, is the site of two Anglo-Saxon cemeteries of the 6th century and early 7th century. One contained an undisturbed ship burial including a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts of outstanding art-historical and archaeological significance, which are now held in the British Museum in London. Other sites before then had already produced significant finds, but many had been looted.Sutton Hoo is of a primary importance to early medieval historians because it sheds light on a period of English history which is on the margin between myth, legend and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated at a time when R&#230;dwald, the ruler of East Anglia, held senior power among the English people, and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship. The site has been vital in understanding the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the whole early Anglo-Saxon period.";1.338808;52.08969051;0

Augusta Treverorum;"The first traces of human settlement in the area of the city show evidence of linear pottery settlements dating from the early Neolithic period. Since the last pre-Christian centuries, members of the Celtic tribe of the Treveri settled in the area of today&#39;s Trier.The Romans under Julius Caesar first subdued the Treveri in 58 to 50 BCE. No later than 16 BCE, at the foot of the hill later christened the Petrisberg, upon which a military camp had been set up in 30 BCE and abandoned again a few months later, the Romans founded the city of Augusta Treverorum (&quot;City of Augustus in the land of the Treveri&quot;), which has a claim to being the oldest city in Germany. The honour of being named after the Emperor was one shared only by Augsburg and Augst in northern Switzerland. Following the reorganisation of the Roman provinces in Germany in 16 BCE, Emperor Augustus decided that the city should become the capital of the province of Belgica. Shortly before 100 CE, an amphitheatre was built, the signal sign of a city of any importance.Trier rose in importance during the Empire&#39;s third-century crisis, as the chief city of the province of Gallia Belgica From 271 to 274 CE, Trier was the second city of the breakaway Gallic Empire, at first under Postumus, who was proclaimed in Cologne, then under his ephemeral successor, Victorinus, who made his base at Trier, where he had rebuilt a large house with a mosaic proclaiming his position as tribune in Postumus&#39; Gallic Praetorian Guard; the city served again as capital under the emperors Tetricus I and II. From the second half of the 3rd century onwards, Trier was the seat of an archbishopric; the first bishop being Eucharius. In the year 275 CE, the city was destroyed in an invasion by the Alamanni. Diocletian recognized the urgency of maintaining an imperial presence in the Gauls, and established first Maximian, then Constantius Chlorus as caesars at Trier; from 293 to 395 CE, Trier was one of the residences of the Western Roman Emperor in Late Antiquity, and its position required the monumental settings that betokened imperial government.";6.6432216;49.75309199;0

Borbetomagus;"The city has existed since before Roman times, when it was captured and fortified by the Romans under Drusus in 14 BCE. From that time, a small troop of infantry and cavalry were garrisoned in Augusta Vangionum; this gave the settlement its Romanized but originally Celtic name Borbetomagus. The garrison developed into a small town with the regularized Roman street plan, a forum, and temples for the main gods Jupiter, Juno, Minerva (upon whose temple, as is usual, was built the cathedral) and Mars.Roman inscriptions and altars and votive offerings can be seen in the archaeological museum, along with one of Europe&#39;s largest collections of Roman glass. Local potters worked in the south quarter of the town. Fragments of amphoras show that the olive oil they contained had come from Hispania Baetica, doubtless by sea and then up the Rhine. At Borbetomagus, Gunther king of the Burgundians, set himself up as puppet-emperor, the unfortunate Jovinus, during the disorders of 411-13. The city became the chief city of the first kingdom of the Burgundians, who left few remains; however, a belt clasp from Worms-Abenheim is a museum treasure. They were overwhelmed in 437 by Hun mercenaries called in by the Roman general A&#235;tius to put an end to Burgundian raids, in an epic disaster that provided the source for the Nibelungenlied.";8.35959652;49.62978255;0

Dobrovody ?;Maydanets was the location of two separate settlements of the Neolithic Cucuteni-Trypillian culture. The first settlement, encompassing about 2 hectares (5 acres), was inhabited from the early 6th Millennium to the late 5th Millennium BC, and is located close to the outskirts of Maydanets along the road to Talne at a location called Grebenyukov Yar. This site was partially excavated by M. Shmaglij and N. Burdo between 1981-1989, during which time three dwellings and two bordei (earth-sheltered dwellings) were discovered and examined.<br/>The second, much larger Cucuteni-Trypillian settlement is located on the left bank of the Tal'ianki River, west of Maydanets, which was inhabited from the 5th Millennium to the early 4th Millennium BC. The settlement encompassed about 250 hectares (600 acres), measuring 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) in length and 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles) wide, and was laid out in an oval pattern. This site was explored by an archaeologcal team led by M. Shmalij from 1971 to 1991, who employed magnetometric analysis to map out the settlement, revealing a total of 1575 buildings, including dwellings, fortifications, sanctuaries, and some two-storied houses. The excavation of the site produced almost 50 artifacts, including a unique collection of painted pottery and figurines. This settlement was one of the largest of the Cucuteni-Trypillian, making it also one of the largest settlements in the world during the time that it flourished.<br/>In addition to the two Cucuteni-Trypillian cultural sites, Maydanets is also the location two other ancient archaeological sites. Two Yamna culture tumuli (burial mounds) are located near the village, containing eight graves dating back to the middle of the 3rd Millennium BC. Also, in the nearby Geliv Stav location, are the remains of a small settlement dating to the 4th century AD of the Chernyakhov culture.<br/>In addition to the local museum in Maydanets, archaeological artifacts taken from local sites may be found in the Cherkasy Regional Museum, the Museum of Agriculture in Talne, the National Museum of History in Kiev, and the Institute of Archaeology, also in Kiev. There are also other nearby towns that are host to Neolithic settlements, including the village of Talianki, where the largest of all the Cucuteni-Trypillian settlements is located.;25.64103539;49.72103992;0

Talianki ?;Talianki was the location of the largest known settlement of the Neolithic Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, encompassing about 450 hectares (1112 acres), and laid out in an oval design of concentric rows of interconnected buildings, and measuring 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) long by 1.1 kilometers (0.7 miles) wide. This settlement, which is located along the H-16 highway between Talianki and the village of Legedzine, is built across a bluff that rises between where the Tal'ianki River and a tributary stream flow together. Dating from 3700 B.C., and at its height having over 15,000 inhabitants, this settlement's size was staggering, making it one of the largest in the world during the time it flourished, as well as the largest settlement in Neolithic Europe.<br/>The ancient settlement was discovered in the 1970s by a Ukrainian pilot who, in his spare time, flew over the country taking infrared photographs from a small plane. After developing these photos, the Talianki and other Cucuteni-Trypillian sites became noticeable due to the differences in heat waves emanating from the soil that covered the ruins in contrast to the surrounding ground. In 1981 the archaeologist V. Kruts began excavation of the site. The results eventually led to the determination that the Talianki settlement contained the remains of 2700 structures, some of which were truly immense, measuring 300 to up to 600 meters in length (980 to 1970 feet) and containing many rooms. Many of the buildings that were examined were two-storeys high. The walls and ceilings of the structures were decorated with red and black designs, reminiscent of similar designs that were found painted on the famous Cucuteni-Trypillian pottery, which along with ceramic figurines, were also found at this site. Further excavations have yielded even more artifacts, making this one of the richest sites in Neolithic Europe.<br/>Built on top of the older Cucuteni-Trypillian settlement are the remains of some Yamna culture tumuli (burial mounds) dating to the middle of the 3rd Millennium B.C. as well as some later graves from the late Bronze Age.;30.5530823;48.80551655;0

Altamira Cave;Altamira is a cave in Spain famous for its Upper Paleolithic cave paintings featuring drawings and polychrome rock paintings of wild mammals and human hands.Its special relevance comes from the fact that it was the first cave in which prehistoric cave paintings were discovered. When the discovery was first made public in 1880, it led to a bitter public controversy between experts which continued into the early 20th century, as many of them did not believe prehistoric man had the intellectual capacity to produce any kind of artistic expression. The acknowledgement of the authenticity of the paintings, which finally came in 1902, changed forever the perception of prehistoric human beings.;-4.11893293;43.37662506;0

Lugdunum;"In 44 BCE, ten years after the conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar was assassinated and civil war erupted. According to the historian Dio Cassius, in 43 BCE, the Roman Senate ordered Munatius Plancus and Lepidus, governors of central and Transalpine Gaul respectively, to found a city for a group of Roman refugees who had been expelled from Vienne (a town about 30 km to the south) by the Allobroges and were encamped at the confluence of the Sa&#244;ne and Rh&#244;ne rivers. Dio Cassius says this was to keep them from joining Mark Antony and bringing their armies into the developing conflict. Epigraphic evidence suggests Munatius Plancus was the principal founder of Lugdunum.Lugdunum seems to have had a population of several thousand at the time of its founding. The citizens were administratively assigned to the Galerian tribe. The earliest Roman buildings were located on the Fourvi&#232;re heights above the Sa&#244;ne river. The Aqueduct of the Gier, completed in the 1st century CE, was the first of four aqueducts supplying water to the city.Within 50 years Lugdunum increased in size and importance, becoming the administrative centre of Roman Gaul and Germany. By the end of the reign of Augustus, Strabo described Lugdunum as the junction of four major roads: south to Narbonensis, Massilia and Italy, north to the Rhine river and Germany, northwest to the Ocean (the English Channel), and west to Aquitania.The proximity to the frontier with Germany made Lugdunum strategically important for the next four centuries, as a staging ground for further Roman expansion into Germany, as well as the de facto capital city and administrative center of the Gallic provinces. Its large and cosmopolitan population made it the commercial and financial heart of the northwestern provinces as well.";4.81886876;45.7596285;0

Aguateca;Aguateca and the nearby city of Dos Pilas were the twin capitals of a powerful dynasty claiming descent from the rulers of Tikal. Around 700 CE, it appears that Dos Pilas Rulers 3 and 4 were responsible for shifting the focus of the dynasty from Dos Pilas to Aguateca, as can be determined from stelas and monuments. In 761 CE, the rulers of Dos Pilas appear to have abandoned their city and relocated to Aguateca. Aguateca became a large, densely populated city, with a higher density of structures than most other lowland Maya sites. It is possible that the population of Aguateca migrated from the Pasion region, but it is likely there was a large population from other regions as well. The influx of people was probably as a result of the political influence of the dynasty. The development of a new center requires a substantial labor force to construct temples, palaces, and a causeway. For the royal family and elites securing a controllable population was essential.;-90.19116461;16.41171499;0

El Tajin;"One of the largest and most important cities of the Classic era of Mesoamerica. A part of the Classic Veracruz culture, El Taj&#237;n flourished from 600 to 1200 CE and during this time numerous temples, palaces, ballcourts, and pyramids were built. From the time the city fell in 1230 to near the end of the 18th century, no European seems to have known of its existence, until a government inspector chanced upon the Pyramid of the Niches in 1785.";-97.37760486;20.44765533;0

El Paraiso;"Architectural complex of the Andean Preceramic and Late Archaic periods of ancient Peru. It is also called the Temple of Chuquitanta. It covers an area of approximately 50 hectares and is located in the valley of Chillon.<br/>It was inhabited at the end of the Late Archaic period. It is contemporary with the Temple of the Crossed Hands Kotosh in Hu&#225;nuco, and with the final phase of Caral-Supe.<br/>It is an enormous stone and mud architecture composed of eight or nine buildings covering an area of approximately 50 hectares. Unit 1 is known by the name of Paradise, which was studied and reconstructed by Engel. The other units, which form mounds have not yet been subjected to research.<br/>The Paradise was built with stones taken from a nearby quarry. There are walls up to 2.40 m. wide, with two faces of flat blocks. Like other buildings of the time, one feature was the use of large shicras, ie networks or vegetable fiber bags filled with stones, used as filler. All walls were plastered together with mud and possibly received a painting application, judging by the remains of ocher pigments, white and red.<br/>The building, with its many compartments, doors and stairs access high, is seated on platforms, giving it a pyramidal appearance.<br/>Engel assumed that Paradise was rebuilt five to six times in the span of about 200 years, and left during the last reconstruction. In here you will find evidence of houses, but has not determined the extent of the town when the building was in effect. No pottery but of cotton and vegetable fiber baskets, shicras calls. They also found five human burials wrapped in cotton sheets.<br/>Its design reveals ceremonial activities, especially in the area known as the main room, where you see a large rectangular pool with a well or colca in each of its corners. The floor framed by the rectangle is completely charred, suggesting that the offerings were burned.";-77.11843261;-11.9539269;0

Bear Creek Mound;"The Bear Creek Mound is typical of the ceremonial Indian Mounds we have seen along our Natchez Trace journey. It is a flat topped temple mound that stands about 10 feet high and is right on the Mississippi-Alabama Border. The mound itself was built less than a 1000 years ago, sometime between 1200 and 1400 AD. At first you may think this is just another old Indian mound; however, the mound is located at the oldest major prehistoric site on the entire Natchez Trace. Dating back more than 10,000 years, the BEAR CREEK MOUND SITE was occupied by migratory hunters as early as 8000 B.C. Just imagine, this site was occupied by human beings for thousands of years, from Paleo times through the Mississippian period.";-88.14111463;34.64309397;0

Atlatl Rock;"Atlatl Rock is named for the Anasazi petroglyph of the Atlatl man, depicted holding his weapon, with a larger atlatl shown above him. The atlatl, used in the Americas as early as 6000 B.C., made spear throwing more efficient by using leverage to add extra force to a throw. It consists of a shaft with a handle on one end and a hook on the other, holding the end of the spear. See the uppermost figure on the sign to help you locate the atlatl petroglyph.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.360globe.net/usa/nevada/valley-of-fire-state-park/atlatl-rock-petroglyphs.html""  target=""_blank"">Panorama at 360globe.net</a>";-114.55114634;36.42299283;0
Aztec Ruins National Monument;"The Aztec Ruins National Monument preserves ancestral Pueblo structures in north-western New Mexico, United States, located close to the town of Aztec and northeast of Farmington, near the Animas River. Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park, with more ancestral Pueblo structures, lies a short distance to the south, just west of Bloomfield near the San Juan River. The buildings date back to the 11th to 13th centuries, and the misnomer attributing them to the Aztec civilization can be traced back to early American settlers in the mid-19th century. The actual construction was by the ancestral Puebloans, the Anasazi.<br/> The site was declared ""Aztec Ruin National Monument"" on January 24, 1923, and with a boundary change it was renamed ""Ruins"" on July 2, 1928. As an historical property of the National Park Service the National Monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. Aztec Ruins was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, as part of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, on December 8, 1987.<br/> Anasazi settlements in North America started during the late 11th century and ran until around 1300. The Anasazi are believed to most likely have moved from these ruins into neighboring areas such as the present day Hopi and Navajo reserves and the pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. These relocations occurred due to drought or loss of nearby fertile land. With no humans living within these, what are now ruins, their settlements slowly were covered by sand and were untouched until the mid 1800s. These ruins would not receive official protection until 1923 when the national monument was established.";-107.99968288;36.83525125;0
Badger House Community;Mesa Verde National Park<br/>The Badger House Community consists of several sites dating from about A.D. 650 to the late 1200s. There are four sites along a paved and gravel walking trail: Modified Basketmaker Pithouse, Developmental Pueblo village, Badger House, and Two Raven House.;-108.53172339;37.18702148;0

Balmoral Mounds;"The three mounds of Balmoral form an equilateral triangle on the east and west sides of US 65, on the south side of Bayou de Rousset. A 1963 investigation found that the site was intensively occupied before mound construction. Decorated ceramics and a radiocarbon sample suggest Balmoral dates to AD 700-1200 (Coles Creek period). In 2003, mapping and coring showed that Mound A is an 11-foot-tall platform mound that measures almost 150 by 165 feet at its base. Domeshaped Mound B is 9 feet tall and about 100 by 130 feet at the base. Mound C, also dome-shaped, is 8 feet tall and about 130 by 150 feet at its base. Cores from Mounds A and C suggest they were built in single stages at about the same time. Although Mound B has not been investigated, artifacts found nearby make it likely that it&#39;s the same age.";-91.24161622;32.13176696;0
